this task is to create an infra using terraform for aws console.
in this I first started with creating provider file, variables, followed by modules and then security_groups, alb and production
I tried to use the best practises for terraform.

provider: This code adds AWS as a provider and sets the credentials
variables: Create the set of variables that will be needed for our infra
Network module: This step builds the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with
  2 public subnets which can be accessed via the internet using the Internet Gateway.
  2 private subnets which are not exposed to the internet and are private to the VPC.
  Create a NAT Gateway in the public subnet and attach it to the private subnets using the route tables, so the private subnets can access the internet.
Security Groups: Create two security groups.
  for EC2 instances — Allows all inbound traffic on port 22 for SSH, allows all traffic only from the Application Load Balancer, and allows all outbound traffic.
  for the Application Load Balancer (ALB) — Allows all inbound traffic on port 80 and allows all outbound traffic.
Load Balancer: This step adds a Load Balancer, listeners, for the Load Balancer, adds Target Groups to route the traffic

run terraform init command first to intitate the providers
to Deploy the infra, 
  run terraform plan command first to revirw the changes that will be applied 
  then run terraform apply command to apply all the changes 
  terraform apply --auto-approve --> to skip the confirmation
  to destroy everything --> terraform destroy command
