to be honest I don't have expreinece in github as I have worked on gitlab
I searched for the things how to make the changes and stuff like this and have given this yaml file for the actions that needs to be performed in order to build, test, deploy 

this yaml file creates a pipeline for the deployment of the app 
triggers with on event --> pipeline will be triggered when 
  there is a push in branch dev, main, master 
  from tag v2
  there is a merge request

env contains the variables to be used in the pipeline

jobs contains all the jobs that will be run for the pipeline
  build-jar: it build the jar file for java project using mvn command and export the artifacts in ./target folder
  sonar-analysis: job depends on the build-jar and publish the sonar report on sonarqube
  docker-pkg: it checkouts to v2 and uses the docker actions to build, publish the image
  deploy-img: deploys the docker image built in the docker-pkg job
